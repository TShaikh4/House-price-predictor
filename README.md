### Understanding the Prediction

1. **Prediction Explanation**:
   - The predicted price of `[4.15194306]` is based on the input features provided in `new_data`, which includes values for various factors like median income, house age, average rooms, etc.

2. **Feature Importance**:
   - The model uses all input features to calculate the predicted price. Changing any of these features will alter the prediction, as the model learns the relationship between these features and the target price during training.

3. **Discrepancy with Actual Price**:
   - The actual price for the first row of the dataset is `4.526`, while the predicted price is `4.15194306`. This discrepancy arises from the model's fitting process, where it aims to minimize overall error across the training data, leading to some individual predictions being off.

### Reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE)

To lower the MSE of your model, consider the following strategies:

1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select relevant features and transform them to better capture relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize or standardize features and handle outliers to reduce noise.

3. **Model Complexity**:
   - Use more complex models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) or apply regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge) to improve generalization.

4. **Model Tuning**:
   - Optimize hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search and implement cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.

5. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Increase the dataset size if possible to enhance the model's learning capability.

6. **Error Analysis**:
   - Analyze residuals to identify patterns or areas of underperformance, guiding further improvements.
